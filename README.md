# ADC-Characterization

This repository has been created to examine the multicore ADC chracteristics. By using histogram.py and adc_phaseandgain_mismatch.py you can dive into the mismatch investigation of your multicore ADC. Beside having a multicore ADC you might also have multiple ADCs on board suffering from gain , phase or timing mismatches which you can also use the files.
